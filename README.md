If I had to summarize my competences, I would say that I have gathered some professional experience in C++, SQL and VCS development tools. During my time at school I have also dibed into C# and Matlab programming. 

In my own free time I always try to pursue something new, different and interesting. 
Currently I am trying to re-learn more of C# and some Unity game development (on my Github profile you can find repositories of a .NET WPF chat application, ASP.NET MVC expense tracker and a work-in-progress Unity horror game project) 
and get some QA testing insight.
